      <h2>About ReadMe</h2>
      <br>
      <p class="about-text">
        ReadMe was conceived after struggling to find the often hidden correlations between what we do and the results therefrom. An advanced daily journal, Readme allows you to input everything you did and everything you experienced in a given day. <br>
        <br>
        After only a few days, you can start to use this information in our custom correlation engine. The engine compares all data points and experiences and finds patterns between the information. Does eating greasy food increase the chances you'll get a migraine? Do you experience more happiness when you watch less nightly news? <br>
        <br>
        Start using ReadMe to track your daily activities the connections in you life.
